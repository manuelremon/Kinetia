# Kinetia - Software Engineering Boutique

> Kinetia is a specialized software engineering boutique focused on inventory optimization, agentic AI systems, and high-performance web applications. We transform complex operational challenges into automated, data-driven solutions using Python, Next.js 15, and modern AI frameworks.

## Core Competencies

### Python Inventory Optimization
- Custom demand forecasting algorithms using Pandas, Prophet, and XGBoost
- Time-series analysis for retail and supply chain operations
- Stock level optimization reducing dead inventory by 30-40%
- Capital efficiency improvements through predictive reordering
- Big data processing pipelines for enterprise-scale operations

### Agentic Process Automation
- AI agents that execute actions, not just respond (RAG + Function Calling)
- ERP integration agents: autonomous document reading, SQL updates, anomaly detection
- LangChain-based procurement and operations automation
- Intelligent document processing: invoices, POs, contracts
- 24/7 autonomous workflow execution

### Next.js Enterprise Development
- Next.js 15 with Server Actions and App Router
- React 19 Server Components for optimal performance
- Full-stack TypeScript with end-to-end type safety
- Core Web Vitals optimization (LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1)
- AWS cloud architecture (Lambda, ECS, S3, RDS)

## Technical Stack

### Languages & Frameworks
- Python 3.11+ (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Prophet, XGBoost)
- TypeScript 5.6+ (strict mode, full type coverage)
- Next.js 15 (App Router, Server Actions, RSC)
- React 19 (Concurrent Features, Suspense)

### AI & Machine Learning
- LangChain (agent orchestration, RAG patterns)
- OpenAI GPT-4 / Claude (reasoning, generation)
- Prophet / XGBoost (time-series forecasting)
- Vector databases (Pinecone, pgvector)
- Function Calling for tool use

### Data & Infrastructure
- PostgreSQL 16 (primary database)
- Redis (caching, queues)
- Apache Airflow (data pipelines)
- BigQuery (analytics)
- AWS / Vercel (cloud deployment)
